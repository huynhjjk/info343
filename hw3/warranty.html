				</div>
				<p>We provide customers the assurance of national parts and labor repair warranty. This therefore guarantees our work on covered parts and labor for 12 months or 12,000 miles from the time of original repair when a customer travels more than 25 miles from our business.</p>
				<h3>How it works:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>When a customer is within 25 miles of the original servicing location, they must return to that location for warranty service repairs.</li>
					<li>When a customer is more than 25 miles from the original servicing location, they can call the Protection Plus toll-free number and are referred to participating locations for warranty repair. ABS will always refer traveling consumers to Protection Plus locations first, whenever possible. If there are no participating locations in the customer’s area, they may take their vehicle to a non-participating repair facility.</li>
					<li>The administrator (Automotive Business Solutions - ABS) administers the claim when the customer is more than 25 miles from the original selling dealer. ABS can be reached at 800-351-8565 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday and Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. excluding holidays.</li>
					<li>The ASE Master Technicians at ABS will verify the warranty repairs that are needed with the repairing facility and authorize the repair up to the original price the customer paid for the service.</li>
					<li>When repairs are complete, the repair facility faxes the original invoice and invoice for the subsequent repair to the administrator (ABS) who pays them with a credit card. Our average time to pay claims is an unheard of 10 minutes!</li>
					<li>The consumer does not have to pay for the warranty repairs, the repairing facility gets paid their retail parts and labor and the original shop does not get charged back for the warranty repairs!</li>
					<li>For more information about the National Service Warranty, call your local ATD distribution center or fill out the information request form and an ATD representative will contact you.</li>
